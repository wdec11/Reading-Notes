# What is a text editor? #

A text editor is a piece of downloadable software that lets you edit text and usually specific text for websites.
Here is a list of important things to look for in a text editor.

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection ofextensions available when you need them

These are important factors to deciding what language you want to use whether its html, css or javascript and the compatibility the
text editor has with your system.

## Basic Terminal usage ##

* **Pwd** stands for Print Working Directory. It tells you what your current or present working directory is.

* **ls** stands for list. It lets you know where you are in the terminal
* Square brackets ( [ ] ) mean that those items are optional, we may run the command with or without them
* 2 types of paths **relative** and **absolute** absolute will have slashes, relative will not.
* In order to move around in the system we use a command called **cd** change directory
* **file** command contains information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* **ls -a** Lists the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
