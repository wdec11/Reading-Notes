# Expressions and Operator Notes

* JavaScript has both unary and binary operators.
* A unary operator only requires one operand either before or after the operator. An *assignment operator* assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of it's right operand




for loop

## 3 parameters seperated by ;

1. declaring the variable and setting its own value
2. condition thst must be met for the loop to run
3. Declare what happens to the variable after each iteration.
* i = index

ex. for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    console.log(i);
    };
