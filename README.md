Hello this is a edit

## *What Growth Mindset means to me*

Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that promotes the development of ones skills through trial and error and hard work. Even when mistakes are made or the initial result isn't the best one, just the act of trying is a positive.

3. Always seek help when needed

# What is a text editor? #

A text editor is a piece of downloadable software that lets you edit text and usually specific text for websites.
Here is a list of important things to look for in a text editor.

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

These are important factors to deciding what language you want to use whether its html, css or javascript and the compatibility the
text editor has with your system.

# Anatomy of an html document #

The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

Html contains up to 6 heading levels

To use a link an anchor <a>

# JS #

* JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

* Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.

* Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".

* Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.
And much more!

* Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.

* APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.

* Two types of APIs are Browser and Third-Party API
