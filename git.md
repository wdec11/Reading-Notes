# Intro to Git #

## What is git? ##

* Git is a DVCS (Distributed Version Control systems) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.

## Important git commands ##

* git add . : add all the files that have been modified/added to git
* git commit -m "insert message here commit all the files that were added
* git push origin main push the code to GitHub
* git status check the status of your work within git
* git clone (url)  clone the repository from your GH account to your local machine

Git status enables you to view files in the directory that either are staged or need to be staged in order to commit. once the file is staged (git add .) it is then ready to be commited (git commit -m "comment" )
 The last step would be to push the updated or new file online. (git push origin main )
