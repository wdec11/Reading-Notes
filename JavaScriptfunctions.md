# JavaScript functions #

* A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

ex. of a function (if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
})
